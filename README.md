# Clock

It shows the current time in an analog clock.

Clock is the Day-2 task of the Javascript30 challenge. It is made just by using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript (i.e. Javascript without any frameworks or libraries)

The HTML and CSS files were already provided before starting the challenge, only the javascript portion was implemented with the help of the tutorial provided in the website of Javascript30 challenge.
